# Second Countable
## Definition
A [topological space](topological_space) is called *second countable* if it has a countable [base](base).
## Examples
1. $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ equipped with the Euclidean topology is second countable, as the set of all open balls with rational centres and rational radii form a base.
2. A metric space equipped with the metric topology is second countable iff it has a countable dense subset.
