# Hausdorff Topological Space
## Definition
Let $\left(X, \tau\right)$ be a [topological space](topological_space). If for every pair of distinct point $x, y \in X$ there are disjoint [open sets](open_set) $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$, then the topological space is called *Hausdorff*.
## Example
Every metric space is Hausdorff in the metric topology.
## Remark
If a topological space is Hausdorff, then all [convergent sequences](convergent_sequence) have unique limits.
