# Base
## Definition
Let $\left(X, \tau\right)$ be a [topological space](topology). Let $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \tau$. If every [open set](open_set) in $\tau$ is a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$, then $\mathcal{B}$ is called a *base*.
## Example
Let $X$ be a metric space equipped with the metric topology. The collection of open balls in $X$ is a base.
