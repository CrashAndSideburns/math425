# Topological Manifold
## Definition
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a [topological space](topological_space) which is [second countable](topological_space/second-countable) and [Hausdorff](topological_space/hausdorff). If every point of $\mathcal{M}$ has a [neighbourhood](neighbourhood) which is [homeomorphic](homeomorphism) to an [open subset](open_set) of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $\mathcal{M}$ is called a *topological manifold of dimension $n$*.
## Remark
If the dimension may be inferred from context, or isn't relevant, one sometimes simply refers to $\mathcal{M}$ as a "topological manifold".
