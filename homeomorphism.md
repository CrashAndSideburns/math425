# Homeomorphism
## Definition
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [topological spaces](topological_space). If $f: X \to Y$ is bijective, and $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are both [continuous](continuous_mapping), then $f$ is called a *homeomorphism* between $X$ and $Y$. If there is a homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$, $X$ and $Y$ are called *homeomorphic*.
