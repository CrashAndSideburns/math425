# Chart
## Definition
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a [topological manifold](topological_manifold). If $x \in \mathcal{M}$, then by definition there exists some [neighbourhood](neighbourhood) $U$ of $x$ which is [homeomorphic](homeomorphism) to an [open subset](open_set) of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Calling the homeomorphism $\varphi$, the tuple $\left(U, \varphi\right)$ is called a *chart*.
