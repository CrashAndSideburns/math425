# Smoothly Compatible Charts
## Definition
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a [topological manifold](topological_manifold), and let $\left(U, \varphi\right)$ and $\left(V, \psi\right)$ be [charts](chart) on $\mathcal{M}$. If the [transition map](transition_map) from $\varphi$ to $\psi$ is a bijection which is $C^{\infty}$ and whose inverse is $C^{\infty}$.
## Remark
Transition maps between compatible charts are instances of what will later be defined as diffeomorphisms. We defer defining diffeomorphisms for now, as it is desirable to define them for functions between manifolds.
