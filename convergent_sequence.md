# Convergent Sequence
## Definition
A sequence $\left\{x_{i}\right\}_{i}$ of points in a [topological space](topological_space) $X$ is said to *converge* to $x \in X$ if for every [neighbourhood](neighbourhood) $U$ of $x$, all but finitely many points of the sequence are contained in $U$.
## Examples
1. Let $X$ be any set equipped with the trivial topology. In this space, all sequences converge to all points of $X$.
2. Let $X$ be any set equipped with the discrete topology. In this space, only sequences which are eventually constant converge.
