# Topology
## Definition
Let $X$ be a set. A set $\tau \subseteq \mathcal{P}\left(X\right)$ is called a *topology* if it satisfies the following conditions:
* $\varnothing, X \in \tau$
* if $A_{i} \in \tau$ for all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, then $\bigcup_{i \in \mathcal{I}}A_{i} \in \tau$
* if $A_{i} \in \tau$ for all $i \in \mathcal{I}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is finite, then $\bigcap_{i \in \mathcal{I}} A_{i} \in \tau$.
## Examples
1. If $\left(X, d\right)$ is a metric space, then the collection of open sets generated by the metric is a topology on $X$, called the *metric topology*. In particular, $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ equipped with the Euclidean metric generates a topology called the *Euclidean topology*.
2. If $X$ is any set, then $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a topology on $X$, called the *discrete topology*.
3. If $X$ is any set, then $\left\{X, \varnothing\right\}$ is a topology on $X$, called the *trivial topology*.
