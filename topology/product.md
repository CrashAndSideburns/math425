# Product Topology
## Definition
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [topological spaces](topological_space). There are projection maps $\pi_{X}: X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_{Y}: X \times Y \to Y$. The coarsest [topology](topology) on $X \times Y$ for which $\pi_{X}$ and $\pi_{Y}$ are [continuous](continuous_mapping) is called the *product topology*. In other words, it is the topology generated by $\tau_{X} \times \tau_{Y}$.
## Remarks
Given $\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{P}\left(X\right)$, there is a unique coarsest topology, which we denote $\tau\left(\mathcal{E}\right)$, which contains $\mathcal{E}$. We do not prove this theorem, but it formalizes what we mean when speaking of a topology "generated" by a family of sets.
